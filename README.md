# Python Common Errors: ZeroDivisionError and IndexError

This repository demonstrates two common errors in Python: 

1. **ZeroDivisionError**: Occurs when attempting to divide by zero. 
2. **IndexError**: Occurs when trying to access an index in a sequence (like a list) that is out of range.

The `bug.py` file contains code that can potentially raise these exceptions. The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to handle these errors gracefully to prevent program crashes.
